            <p>RetainPulse is a one-time service, not a recurring subscription. Fees are structured in two milestones:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-3">
              <li><strong>Installation fee:</strong> $100 (or the Founding Member rate) — payable upfront before installation begins.</li>
              <li><strong>Management fee:</strong> $149 (or the Founding Member rate) — payable after 7 days of the installation, once you have seen the value.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-3">Payments are processed through Payoneer. You will receive an invoice for each milestone. After the 30-day management period ends, you keep the widget and dashboard forever with no recurring fees.</p>
